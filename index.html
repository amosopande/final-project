        TRIBES</h2>    
    <h3>1. The Kalenjin</h3>
        <p>
            The Kalenjins are part of Highland Nilotes sub-group of the Nilotic ethinic group.
            They are known Highland Nilotes because they settled at the highlands in the Rift Valley region of Kenya.
            They practice pastoralism known by owning large herds of cattle.
            They are known to be good athletes especially longdistance running such as Eliud Kipchoge, the marathon world record holder.
            They are known for their unique "Mursik" which is fermented milk mixed with coal of burnt herbal plants. It is stored in a specially made calabash gourd locally known as sotet.
